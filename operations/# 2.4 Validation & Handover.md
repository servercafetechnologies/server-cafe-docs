# 2.4 Validation & Handover

Validation and handover is the final stage of deployment, confirming that all prior steps (2.1–2.3) have been successfully executed and documented. This process ensures the node is production-ready, compliant with operational standards, and safe to transition into day-to-day operations.

## 2.4.1 Pre-Validation Review

**Objective:** Confirm that all required deliverables from site preparation, rack installation, and software setup are complete.

**Procedure:**
- Review deliverables from:
  - Section 2.1: Site Approval Report, Power Budgeting Certificate.
  - Section 2.2: Rack Installation Report, Server Inventory Sheet, Network Configuration Report.
  - Section 2.3: OS Commissioning Report, Kubernetes Deployment Report, Orchestration Commissioning Report, Protocol & Logging Verification Report, Monitoring Commissioning Report.
- Verify signatures from Operations Lead, Compliance Officer, and HITL Coordinator where required.
- Cross-check documentation against version control in GitHub compliance repository.

**Deliverable:** A **Pre-Validation Checklist** signed by the Deployment Manager.

## 2.4.2 Functional Testing

**Objective:** Validate that the system performs correctly under operational conditions.

**Procedure:**
- Execute functional tests:
  - Input validation (Dawn) with malformed and compliant test data.
  - Multi-vendor consensus workflow (Day) with at least three AI vendor integrations.
  - Compliance output (Dusk) with GDPR and HIPAA compliance scenarios.
- Conduct HITL arbitration drills with operators resolving flagged divergences.
- Validate redundancy:
  - Power failover (solar → battery → grid → generator).
  - Networking VLAN isolation and failover.
  - Rack sensor alerting and SIEM integration.

**Deliverable:** A **Functional Test Report** with pass/fail status for each scenario.

## 2.4.3 Performance Testing

**Objective:** Establish performance baselines and ensure system meets operational SLAs.

**Procedure:**
- Run benchmark tests:
  - Throughput: Minimum 300 tokens/sec (residential), 600+ tokens/sec (commercial).
  - Latency: Sub-200ms response time for internal orchestration messages.
  - Power efficiency: ≤ 0.5 kWh per 1M tokens processed.
- Conduct stress tests at 125% load for 2 hours to validate cooling and redundancy.
- Record baseline HITL metrics:
  - Average arbitration time < 45s.
  - Escalation ratio < 5%.

**Deliverable:** A **Performance Benchmark Report** with raw data, graphs, and SLA compliance confirmation.

---

## 2.4.4 Security Validation

**Objective:** Confirm that security measures are active, effective, and auditable.

**Procedure:**
- Verify perimeter, entry, and rack security sensors report to SIEM.
- Review access logs for accuracy and YAML-stamped integrity.
- Conduct red-team penetration test against:
  - Physical entry.
  - Orchestration APIs.
  - Logging/audit systems.
- Validate encryption:
  - TLS 1.3 enforced across all services.
  - SHA-256 log hashing verified against test dataset.

**Deliverable:** A **Security Validation Report** with findings, remediation steps, and final pass/fail status.

---

## 2.4.5 Handover to Operations

**Objective:** Transition the node from deployment to live operations.

**Procedure:**
- Conduct onboarding session with HITL operators:
  - Review dashboards, arbitration workflows, and escalation procedures.
  - Run live drills simulating divergence cases.
- Transfer all documentation into the compliance repository.
- Present final deployment package at an **Operations Readiness Review (ORR)** with stakeholders.
- Obtain final signoff from:
  - Operations Lead.
  - Compliance Officer.
  - HITL Coordinator.
  - Chief Security Officer (if applicable).

**Deliverable:** A signed **Deployment Certification Packet**, officially transferring the node into Section 3 (Day-to-Day Operations).
