# 1. Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this Operations Manual is to provide **explicit, actionable guidance** for the deployment, daily management, and long-term maintenance of Server Café Technologies’ distributed AI orchestration nodes. This manual is written to serve as the **single source of truth** for engineering, operations, compliance, and HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) personnel. Every instruction is spelled out in detail so that a new operations team, with no prior exposure to Server Café, can deploy and manage a node safely, consistently, and in compliance with our architectural and ethical principles.

## 1.1 Purpose

The Operations Manual exists to:

1. **Standardize Operations Across Sites**  
   - Ensure every Server Café node — whether residential prototype, commercial deployment, or hybrid integration — is built and run to the same technical and ethical standards.  
   - Provide uniform documentation for audits, compliance reviews, and partner integrations.  

2. **Integrate Human-in-the-Loop Governance**  
   - Codify HITL roles as a required element of every operational process.  
   - Document the workflow handoffs between automated orchestration layers (Dawn, Day, Dusk) and the human operators who arbitrate divergence, bias, or compliance concerns.  

3. **Guarantee Sustainability and Resilience**  
   - Define operational procedures that align with Server Café’s solar-first model.  
   - Incorporate resilience planning: grid fallback, battery storage, and failover operations.  
   - Minimize environmental footprint while ensuring operational continuity.  

4. **Provide Engineering and Compliance Clarity**  
   - Bridge the gap between engineering specs, regulatory requirements, and day-to-day operational practices.  
   - Ensure that compliance, cybersecurity, and safety requirements are not abstract “checklists,” but embedded into the actual workflows operators follow.

## 1.2 Scope

This manual applies to **all personnel and all infrastructure** associated with Server Café Technologies nodes, specifically:

- **Physical Infrastructure**  
  - Rack-mounted servers, edge appliances, networking gear, UPS systems, solar panels, HVAC, fire suppression, and security systems.  
  - Installation, inspection, and maintenance procedures.  

- **Software Infrastructure**  
  - Operating systems, container orchestration, monitoring agents, and security hardening.  
  - Dawn–Day–Dusk orchestration layers, YAML-stamped protocols, and multi-vendor integration mechanisms.  

- **Human Operations (HITL)**  
  - Operator responsibilities, training requirements, certification, and escalation procedures.  
  - Monitoring dashboards, arbitration workflows, and compliance signoff.  

- **Compliance and Auditability**  
  - Logging requirements (YAML-stamped, immutable, replicated).  
  - Data residency controls across U.S., NATO, and Global stacks.  
  - Regulatory reporting to relevant authorities.  

- **Emergency Response and Resilience**  
  - Disaster recovery procedures, failover operations, and power continuity measures.  
  - Operator and public safety protocols, communication playbooks, and regulator notifications.  

- **Continuous Improvement**  
  - Feedback loops from HITL operators and system monitoring.  
  - Procedures for testing, piloting, and integrating innovations without risking production stability.

## 1.3 Outputs and Ownership

- **Outputs of Section 1**  
  - Establishes the authority of this manual as binding for all operations.  
  - Defines the scope of infrastructure, software, and human processes covered.  
  - Provides a clear orientation for new team members, regulators, and partners.  

- **Ownership**  
  - **Operations Lead**: Maintains and updates this manual.  
  - **Compliance Officer**: Verifies alignment with regulatory and legal requirements.  
  - **Engineering Director**: Ensures technical accuracy and feasibility.  
  - **HITL Coordinator**: Confirms integration of operator procedures and safety.  

Updates must be reviewed **quarterly** and formally versioned in the Server Café GitHub repository.
