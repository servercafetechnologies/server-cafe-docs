- Copies shipped daily to compliance archive.

**Sample YAML Log:**
```yaml
message_type: maintenance_log
from: Maintenance_Team
purpose: quarterly_hardware_validation
payload:
  task_id: Q2-2025-001
  actions:
    - solar_panel_cleaning
    - ups_capacity_test
    - hvac_redundancy_switch
  results: pass
  timestamp: 2025-09-22T09:00:00Z
```
