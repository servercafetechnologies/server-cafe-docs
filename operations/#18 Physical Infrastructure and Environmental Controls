  * Load Rating: ≥3,000 lbs.
  * Lockable doors with acoustic dampening options.

* **Power Distribution Units (PDUs)**:

  * Smart PDUs with per-outlet monitoring.
  * Redundant A/B feeds.

* **Servers**:

  * Edge-grade, ruggedized for high-heat environments.
  * Hot-swappable drives and PSUs.

---

## **18.4 Power and Energy Management**

* **Solar Arrays**:

  * Minimum: 120% of average load.
  * Example: Two-rack node requires \~50 kW solar system【25†source】.

* **Battery Backup**:

  * Minimum 6 hours runtime at full load.
  * EG4 rack batteries or equivalent.

* **Generator**:

  * Optional for residential nodes.
  * Recommended for commercial nodes (≥75 kW capacity).

* **Energy Monitoring**:

  * Real-time dashboards for solar, battery, grid draw.
  * Alerts for low charge (<25%).

---

## **18.5 Cooling Infrastructure**

* **HVAC**:

  * Mini-split systems (Daikin/Mitsubishi, SEER ≥20).
  * Capacity: \~2 tons per 8–10 kW of heat load【25†source】.
  * Humidity: Maintain <50% RH.

* **Airflow**:

  * Hot/cold aisle containment.
  * Blanking panels in unused rack spaces.

* **Monitoring**:

  * Sensors for temp/humidity every 10U in rack.
  * Alert if >27°C sustained for 10 min.

---

## **18.6 Fire Protection**

* **Suppression**:

  * Stat-X condensed aerosol units (rack-mounted).
  * Room-level FM-200 or equivalent.

* **Fire Barriers**:

  * Roxul Safe’n’Sound insulation (1200°F rating).
  * UL 2-hour wall/fireproof container【25†source】.

---

## **18.7 Electromagnetic and Acoustic Controls**

* **Faraday Cage**:

  * Copper mesh (≥60 dB shielding effectiveness).
  * Ground bonded to facility busbar.

* **Acoustic Design**:

  * Soundproof rack doors.
  * Mass Loaded Vinyl panels for walls.
  * Target noise reduction: 15–20 dB【25†source】.

---

## **18.8 Environmental Sustainability**

* **Recycled Hardware**: Target 30–40% refurbished components.
* **E-Waste**: Certified recycling partners only.
* **Hybrid Energy**: Solar primary, wind/grid backup where feasible.
* **Green Certification**: Aim for LEED Silver/Gold for commercial facilities.

---

## **18.9 Monitoring and Maintenance**

* **Routine Inspections**:

  * Weekly HVAC filter checks.
  * Monthly UPS/battery health reports.
  * Quarterly rack integrity checks.

* **Maintenance Logs**:

  * Stored in `/srv/ops/infra-logs/`.
  * YAML format:

    ```yaml
    infra_log:
      node: SC-Node-US-12
      inspection_date: 2025-08-23
      hvac_status: normal
      battery_status: 92% capacity
      rack_integrity: secure
      inspector: TECH-22
    ```

---

## **18.10 Staff Responsibilities**

* **Facilities Manager**: Oversees HVAC, power, and fire systems.
* **Engineers**: Perform inspections, log results.
* **SecOps**: Verify physical security compliance.
* **Compliance Officers**: Ensure environmental and safety certifications.

---

## **18.11 Summary**

Server Café’s physical and environmental controls ensure that **infrastructure is safe, resilient, and sustainable**. By standardizing racks, power systems, cooling, and fire protection, nodes operate securely under diverse conditions while meeting green energy commitments.
