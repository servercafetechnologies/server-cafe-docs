# 6. Resilience and Continuity

Resilience and continuity measures guarantee that Server Café nodes remain operational during power failures, hardware faults, or security incidents. This section defines power continuity systems, fault tolerance mechanisms, emergency response protocols, and documentation requirements.

---

## 6.1 Power & Energy Resilience

### 6.1.1 Battery Backup
**Objective:** Sustain operations during solar or grid outages.
- Residential: 40–85 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery bank.
- Commercial: 200–400 kWh modular battery arrays.
- Redundant Battery Management Systems (BMS) with real-time monitoring.
- Alarms triggered at SOC < 20%.

**Deliverable:** Quarterly **Battery Health Report** with cycle counts, SOC trends, and replacement planning.

---

### 6.1.2 Grid Tie
**Objective:** Provide reliable secondary power source.
- Residential: 200A service panel minimum.
- Commercial: 480V three-phase interconnect.
- Net metering agreements required for all nodes.
- Automatic transfer switches for seamless switchover.

**Deliverable:** A **Grid Interconnect Certificate** including utility approval.

---

### 6.1.3 Backup Generation
**Objective:** Ensure tertiary power for extended outages.
- Residential: Optional 10–15 kW standby generator.
- Commercial: Required 50–100 kW diesel generator with 48h fuel supply.
- Noise suppression: ≤ 70 dBA at property line.
- Monthly test under load.

**Deliverable:** Monthly **Generator Test Log** with runtime and maintenance history.

---

## 6.2 Fault Tolerance

### 6.2.1 Node Failover
**Objective:** Maintain service continuity if a node fails.
- Failover triggered if node unresponsive > 60s.
- Load redistributed across peer nodes within same stack.
- HITL operators notified of failover event.

**Deliverable:** A **Failover Test Report** documenting simulated outages and recovery times.

---

### 6.2.2 Data Redundancy
**Objective:** Prevent data loss and ensure audit log immutability.
- Triple replication across racks: one primary, two secondaries.
- Replication paths separated across different PDUs and network segments.
- Integrity check every 15 minutes via checksum validation.
- Daily snapshot exports to compliance archive.

**Deliverable:** A **Data Integrity Report** including replication logs and checksum verification.

---

### 6.2.3 Compliance Zones
**Objective:** Isolate data by jurisdiction to prevent cross-contamination.
- US, NATO, and Global stacks physically separated at rack level.
- VLAN isolation enforced on all network switches.
- Cross-zone transfers permitted only by:
  - Dual-approval workflow (Ops Lead + Compliance Officer).
  - YAML-stamped log entry with justification.
- Unauthorized transfer attempt = critical alert.

**Deliverable:** A **Compliance Zone Report** with approved transfers, justifications, and alerts.

---

## 6.3 Emergency Procedures

### 6.3.1 Disaster Recovery
**Objective:** Restore service after catastrophic failures.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): ≤ 12 hours.
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): ≤ 15 minutes.
- Pre-staged backup hardware at alternate site.
- Annual disaster recovery drill required.

**Deliverable:** An **Annual Disaster Recovery Report** documenting drill results.

---

### 6.3.2 Operator Safety
**Objective:** Protect HITL and maintenance personnel during emergencies.
- Quarterly evacuation drills.
- PPE available onsite: respirators, gloves, fire blankets.
- Emergency lighting and exit signage tested monthly.

**Deliverable:** A **Safety Drill Report** filed quarterly.

---

### 6.3.3 Public Communication
**Objective:** Provide consistent, transparent communication in crises.
- Pre-written regulator notification templates.
- Crisis press release drafts stored in comms binder.
- Public website banner system for outage notifications.
- Designated spokesperson trained for press inquiries.

**Deliverable:** A **Crisis Communication Packet** updated annually.

---

## 6.4 Final Approval

**Objective:** Certify that resilience and continuity measures are tested and functional.

**Procedure:**
- Validate quarterly Battery Health Report, monthly Generator Test Log, Failover Test Report, Data Integrity Report, and Safety Drill Report.
- Confirm cross-zone transfer controls tested.
- Obtain signoff from Operations Lead, Compliance Officer, and Chief Security Officer.

**Deliverable:** A signed **Resilience & Continuity Approval Certificate**, required for annual compliance audits and SLA verification.
