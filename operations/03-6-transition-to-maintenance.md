# 3.6 Transition to Maintenance

The transition to maintenance defines how Server Caf√© nodes move from daily operational workflows into scheduled or corrective maintenance cycles. This ensures that nodes remain reliable and compliant without disrupting 24/7 service guarantees.

---

## 3.6.1 Purpose

**Objectives:**
- Formalize the handoff from daily operators to maintenance staff.
- Ensure service continuity during scheduled downtime.
- Document all maintenance activities in compliance archives.
- Trigger reviews when repeated operational issues point to underlying infrastructure problems.

---

## 3.6.2 Transition Triggers

**Scheduled Maintenance:**
- Routine hardware checks (quarterly or annual).
- Software patching and protocol schema updates.
- Fire suppression and HVAC certification tests.

**Unscheduled Maintenance:**
- Repeated SLA breaches (e.g., uptime < 99.9%).
- Escalation ratios exceeding thresholds for > 1 week.
- Hardware failures (UPS, battery, cooling, servers).
- Security incidents requiring forensic review.

---

## 3.6.3 Transition Procedure

1. **Incident or Schedule Review**
   - Operations Lead reviews Daily Ops Summary Reports for triggers.
   - Maintenance Manager confirms maintenance need.

2. **Pre-Maintenance Preparation**
   - Issue Maintenance Notification 72 hours in advance (scheduled) or immediate alert (unscheduled).
   - Generate Work Order with task list, assigned personnel, and expected downtime.
   - Ensure redundancy measures active (failover to peer nodes if required).

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Place node in **maintenance mode** (traffic rerouted).
   - Perform tasks as defined in Work Order.
   - Document all actions with YAML-stamped entries.

4. **Post-Maintenance Validation**
   - Run functional tests (input validation, consensus routing, HITL arbitration, compliance synthesis).
   - Validate uptime restoration, cooling efficiency, and power systems.
   - HITL operators perform arbitration drills to confirm operational readiness.

5. **Documentation and Signoff**
   - Compile Maintenance Packet with:
     - Work Order.
     - Task Completion Log.
     - Functional Test Report.
     - Signatures from Maintenance Manager, Operations Lead, and Compliance Officer.

**Sample YAML Maintenance Log:**
```yaml
message_type: maintenance_event
from: Ops_Team
stack: us
purpose: quarterly_patch
payload:
  work_order_id: WO-2025-09-14-001
  tasks_completed:
    - kernel_patch_5.15.0
    - dawn_layer_schema_update
    - hvac_filter_replacement
  validation_status: pass
  timestamp: 2025-09-14T03:15:00Z
```

---

## 3.6.4 Continuous Review

- Repeated transitions (>3 per quarter) trigger joint review with Operations Lead, Maintenance Manager, and HITL Coordinator.
- Root cause analysis performed for recurring failures.
- Preventive maintenance plans updated accordingly.

---

## 3.6.5 Final Approval

**Objective:** Certify that transition to maintenance is controlled, documented, and reversible.

**Procedure:**
- Verify Maintenance Packet completeness.
- Confirm post-maintenance validation tests meet operational SLAs.
- Obtain joint approval from Operations Lead, Maintenance Manager, and Compliance Officer.

**Deliverable:** A signed **Maintenance Transition Certificate**, filed in compliance archives, enabling shift into Section 4 (Maintenance Cycles).
