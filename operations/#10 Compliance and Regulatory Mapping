# **Section 10: Compliance and Regulatory Mapping**

This section defines how Server Café operations align with regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. It is a mandatory reference for compliance officers, auditors, and system operators. Every deployment—U.S., NATO, or Global—must adhere to the applicable mapping outlined here.

---

## **10.1 Purpose of Regulatory Mapping**

Compliance in Server Café is not optional. Regulatory mapping ensures:

* **Legal Operation** – Nodes operate within local and international law.
* **Client Trust** – Demonstrates adherence to privacy and data security obligations.
* **Operational Safety** – Prevents cross-border violations or export control breaches.
* **Audit Readiness** – Provides clear traceability for regulators.

---

## **10.2 Regulatory Zones and Stack Separation**

Server Café uses a **three-tier regulatory architecture**【25†source】:

1. **U.S. Domestic Stack**

   * **Vendors Allowed**: U.S.-based only (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
   * **Applicable Regulations**:

     * ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations)
     * EAR (Export Administration Regulations)
     * FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)
     * CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)
     * HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
     * CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

2. **NATO/Allied Stack**

   * **Vendors Allowed**: U.S., Canadian, European, and allied-country vendors (e.g., Mistral, Aleph Alpha).
   * **Applicable Regulations**:

     * GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
     * PIPEDA (Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)
     * EU Dual-Use Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009)

3. **Global Stack**

   * **Vendors Allowed**: Broader set including non-aligned models (e.g., DeepSeek).
   * **Applicable Regulations**:

     * Local jurisdiction laws (e.g., India DPDP Act 2023)
     * Transparency and consent-based disclosures
     * Strict physical and logical separation from NATO/U.S. stacks

---

## **10.3 Mapping to Server Café Architecture**

### Dawn (Input Validation)

* **U.S. Stack**: Filters for ITAR/EAR-controlled data.
* **NATO Stack**: Enforces GDPR-compliant consent and data minimization.
* **Global Stack**: Flags data for explicit disclosure requirements.

### Day (Mediation & Reasoning)

* **U.S. Stack**: No outbound relay to non-U.S. vendors.
* **NATO Stack**: Encrypted routing with jurisdiction tags in YAML payloads.
* **Global Stack**: Limited mediation; requires signed user consent.

### Dusk (Synthesis & Compliance)

* **U.S. Stack**: Generates FedRAMP-compliant audit trails.
* **NATO Stack**: Maintains GDPR Article 30 processing records.
* **Global Stack**: Applies jurisdiction-specific disclaimers.

---

## **10.4 Data Residency and Sovereignty**

* **Storage**: Each stack maintains **physically isolated storage**. Data never crosses between stacks.
* **Retention**:

  * U.S.: 1 year minimum (per CMMC)
  * NATO: 6–12 months (per GDPR)
  * Global: Configurable per-client contract
* **Deletion**: Secure wipe (DoD 5220.22-M 3-pass) within 30 days of request.

---

## **10.5 Compliance Logging Requirements**

* **Format**: YAML-stamped, immutable logs.
* **Fields Required**:

  * `request_id`
  * `stack` (US/NATO/Global)
  * `jurisdiction`
  * `data_classification`
  * `processing_steps`
  * `reviewer_id` (HITL supervisor)
  * `compliance_checks_passed`

**Example:**

```yaml
compliance_log:
  request_id: RQ-2025-1984
  stack: NATO
  jurisdiction: EU
  data_classification: personal
  processing_steps:
    - dawn_validation: GDPR_consent_check
    - day_mediation: AI_consensus
    - dusk_synthesis: GDPR_audit_entry
  reviewer_id: SUP-2231
  compliance_checks_passed: true
```

---

## **10.6 Cross-Border Data Handling**

* **Prohibited**: Any automatic transfer of personal data between stacks.
* **Allowed**: Cross-stack insights only via anonymized metadata or aggregated statistics.
* **HITL Requirement**: Human supervisor must authorize and log all cross-border mediation attempts.

---

## **10.7 Certification and Audit Cycles**

* **U.S. Stack**:

  * Annual FedRAMP audit
  * CMMC Level 2 certification every 3 years
* **NATO Stack**:

  * GDPR compliance audits annually
  * ISO 27001 certification renewal every 3 years
* **Global Stack**:

  * Client-driven audits per jurisdiction
  * Independent annual third-party compliance report

---

## **10.8 Enforcement and Escalation**

* **Violation Response**:

  * Immediate suspension of offending node
  * Incident report within 24 hours
  * Root-cause analysis within 7 days
* **Escalation Path**:

  * Compliance Officer → Operations Manager → External Regulator (if unresolved)

---

## **10.9 Staff Responsibilities**

* **Compliance Officers**: Maintain mapping documentation and update with regulatory changes.
* **Engineers**: Implement stack-specific controls in Dawn, Day, and Dusk layers.
* **Operators**: Ensure every query is logged with jurisdictional metadata.
* **Auditors**: Verify that logs match requirements in Sections 10.3–10.6.

---

## **10.10 Summary**

Compliance and regulatory mapping transforms Server Café from a technical platform into a **legally defensible system**. By aligning each stack (U.S., NATO, Global) with jurisdiction-specific laws and embedding compliance directly into Dawn, Day, and Dusk, Server Café guarantees transparency, sovereignty, and trustworthiness.
