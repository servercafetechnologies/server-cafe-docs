# 3. Day-to-Day Operations

Day-to-Day Operations define the standard procedures for running a Server Café node once deployment has been validated and handed over. These operations combine automated orchestration with human-in-the-loop (HITL) oversight to ensure transparency, compliance, and resilience. This section establishes daily workflows, operator responsibilities, and system monitoring practices.

## 3.1 Objectives of Day-to-Day Operations

1. **Maintain Continuous Service**  
   Ensure 24/7 uptime with a target of 99.9% availability across all stacks.

2. **Integrate Human Oversight**  
   Guarantee that every orchestration cycle involving divergence, bias, or compliance triggers is reviewed and signed by a HITL operator.

3. **Preserve Compliance and Auditability**  
   Generate immutable, YAML-stamped audit logs for all system events and operator interventions.

4. **Sustain Operational Efficiency**  
   Optimize use of solar and battery resources while minimizing reliance on grid and generator fallback.

5. **Enable Continuous Feedback**  
   Provide operators with structured channels to propose improvements, report anomalies, and suggest workflow refinements.

## 3.2 Operational Layers

Day-to-day operations are structured across three interdependent layers:

1. **Automated Layer (System-Driven)**  
   - Handles baseline orchestration: request ingestion, consensus routing, compliance checks.  
   - Executes monitoring, logging, and automated failover protocols.  

2. **Human Layer (HITL Operators)**  
   - Resolves divergences between AI outputs.  
   - Validates bias detection flags.  
   - Approves or escalates compliance-sensitive outputs.  

3. **Oversight Layer (Management & Compliance)**  
   - Reviews daily operational logs.  
   - Audits HITL performance metrics.  
   - Ensures adherence to regulatory frameworks.

## 3.3 Daily Rhythm of Operations

1. **Morning System Check (0000–0400 UTC)**  
   - Automated log rollovers and system updates.  
   - Operator review of overnight alerts.  
   - Confirmation of solar/battery performance from prior cycle.  

2. **Shift-Based Monitoring (24/7 Coverage)**  
   - HITL operators rotate in 8-hour shifts.  
   - Continuous arbitration of flagged orchestration sessions.  
   - Escalation to Tier 2 operators or Compliance Officer when thresholds exceeded.  

3. **Evening Wrap-Up (2000–2200 UTC)**  
   - Generate Daily Ops Summary Report.  
   - Submit YAML-stamped activity logs to compliance archive.  
   - Cross-check inventory (power, cooling, operator activity).

## 3.4 Core Tools Used in Operations

- **Operator Console Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of divergence cases, bias alerts, and arbitration tasks.  
- **Prometheus + Grafana:** Metrics collection and dashboards for system health.  
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** Centralized log management.  
- **SIEM Platform:** Security event correlation (rack access, intrusion detection, system anomalies).  
- **YAML Audit Trail Generator:** Ensures all events are stamped, hashed, and archived.  

---

## 3.5 Outputs of Day-to-Day Operations

- **Daily Ops Summary Report**: Operator activity, arbitration metrics, incidents.  
- **System Health Report**: Uptime, latency, throughput, power efficiency.  
- **Compliance Archive Update**: Immutable YAML logs of all orchestration and operator actions.  
- **Operator Feedback Log**: Documented observations and improvement proposals.

## 3.6 Transition to Maintenance

Day-to-day operations run continuously, with maintenance cycles (Section 4) layered in according to schedule. Any deviation from daily workflows—such as repeated SLA breaches or recurring operator escalations—must trigger a joint review with the Operations Lead, Compliance Officer, and HITL Coordinator.
