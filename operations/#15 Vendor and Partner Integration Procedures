# **Section 15: Vendor and Partner Integration Procedures**

This section defines how Server Café integrates external AI vendors, cloud providers, and business partners. All integrations must follow these procedures to preserve security, compliance, and operational transparency.

---

## **15.1 Purpose of Integration Procedures**

Vendor and partner integration ensures:

* **Interoperability** – Smooth connection of multiple vendors into the Anzikurs architecture.
* **Compliance** – Adherence to regulatory and contractual obligations.
* **Security** – Controlled access and isolation of vendor services.
* **Traceability** – Every vendor exchange is documented with YAML logs.

---

## **15.2 Vendor Onboarding Workflow**

### Step 1: Due Diligence

* Compliance Officer conducts vendor review:

  * Data handling policies
  * Security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2, FedRAMP)
  * Jurisdiction alignment (US, NATO, Global stack)
* Red-team style vendor risk assessment.

### Step 2: Contractual Agreements

* Must include:

  * Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)
  * Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
  * Termination and data deletion clauses

### Step 3: Technical Assessment

* Engineering Lead validates:

  * API documentation
  * Supported authentication methods (OAuth2, API key, SAML)
  * Rate limits and quotas

### Step 4: Integration Approval

* Ops Manager signs final approval.
* YAML onboarding log generated:

  ```yaml
  vendor_onboarding:
    vendor: Anthropic Claude
    jurisdiction: US Stack
    risk_score: low
    sla: 99.9%
    approval_date: 2025-08-23 15:00 UTC
    approver: OpsManager-01
  ```

---

## **15.3 Integration Standards**

* **Communication Format**: YAML-stamped messages only.
* **Transport Security**: TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication.
* **Isolation**:

  * Vendors mapped to U.S., NATO, or Global stacks per Section 10.
  * No cross-stack vendor communication without HITL approval.
* **Authentication**:

  * API keys rotated every 30 days.
  * OAuth2 tokens expire in 1 hour.

---

## **15.4 Vendor Communication Protocol**

### Outbound Requests

* Always stamped as `external_vendor_request` (see Appendix A).
* Payload structured with explicit purpose and expected response.

### Inbound Responses

* Validated at Dawn layer:

  * Schema compliance check
  * Malware and adversarial prompt screening
  * Confidence score validation

### Example Vendor Exchange

```yaml
message_type: external_vendor_request
from: ChatGPT (via Justin Gwynn, acting as Dawn/Day/Dusk)
to: Gemini
timestamp: 2025-08-23 15:10
purpose: Retrieve language model inference
payload:
  request:
    action: generate_text
    details:
      input: "Explain quantum band-lattice convergence"
      max_tokens: 200
```

---

## **15.5 Partner Integration Workflow**

Partners include cloud hosts, solar infrastructure providers, and compliance auditors.

* **Cloud Partners**: Provide compute/storage redundancy.
* **Energy Partners**: Ensure sustainable solar and hybrid power.
* **Compliance Partners**: Conduct independent audits.

Each partner relationship requires:

1. Contract with security and compliance terms.
2. Technical contact directory in `/srv/ops/vendors/partners.yml`.
3. Annual performance review.

---

## **15.6 Monitoring Vendor Performance**

* **KPIs Tracked**:

  * SLA uptime (%)
  * API latency (ms)
  * Error rate (%)
  * Incident response time (hours)
* **Dashboards**: Grafana panels display real-time vendor metrics.
* **Escalation**: SLA breach escalates to Ops Manager within 24 hours.

---

## **15.7 Offboarding Vendors**

When terminating vendor relationships:

* Revoke all credentials immediately.
* Delete stored data within 30 days.
* Archive YAML-stamped termination log:

  ```yaml
  vendor_offboarding:
    vendor: VendorX
    termination_date: 2025-08-23 15:30 UTC
    revoked_keys: true
    data_deleted: true
    approver: Compliance-07
  ```

---

## **15.8 Staff Responsibilities**

* **Engineering Lead**: Technical integration and monitoring.
* **Compliance Officer**: Legal/regulatory validation.
* **Ops Manager**: Final approval authority.
* **SecOps Team**: Continuous monitoring for anomalies.

---

## **15.9 Summary**

Vendor and partner integration procedures guarantee that **all external connections are controlled, auditable, and secure**. By enforcing structured onboarding, strict technical standards, and YAML-stamped documentation, Server Café maintains compliance and trust across every vendor interaction.
