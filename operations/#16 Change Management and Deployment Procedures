# **Section 16: Change Management and Deployment Procedures**

This section governs how Server Café manages, tests, and deploys changes to infrastructure, software, and operational procedures. Strict adherence ensures stability, traceability, and compliance.

---

## **16.1 Purpose of Change Management**

Change management ensures:

* **Stability** – Prevents untested changes from disrupting production.
* **Traceability** – Every change is logged and auditable.
* **Compliance** – Deployment processes align with ISO 20000, ITIL, and NIST guidelines.
* **Security** – Reduces risk of unauthorized or malicious modifications.

---

## **16.2 Change Classification**

1. **Standard Change**

   * Pre-approved, low risk (e.g., patching, certificate renewal).
   * Requires CR submission but expedited approval.

2. **Normal Change**

   * Planned, medium/high impact (e.g., new feature deployment).
   * Requires full review and Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval.

3. **Emergency Change**

   * Urgent, unplanned (e.g., security patch for zero-day).
   * Requires immediate Ops Manager approval.
   * Logged as emergency with post-review.

---

## **16.3 Change Request (CR) Workflow**

### Step 1: Submission

* Engineer or officer submits CR in system (`/srv/ops/cr-tracker`).
* Fields required:

  * `CR_ID`
  * `Change_Type` (Standard, Normal, Emergency)
  * `Description`
  * `Impact_Assessment`
  * `Rollback_Plan`

### Step 2: Review

* **Engineering Lead**: Technical feasibility.
* **Compliance Officer**: Legal/regulatory risks.
* **Ops Manager**: Operational risk and scheduling.

### Step 3: Testing

* Change tested in staging environment.
* Automated CI/CD pipelines enforce unit tests, integration tests, and security scans.

### Step 4: Approval

* CAB approval required for Normal changes.
* Emergency changes require Ops Manager sign-off.

### Step 5: Deployment

* Deployment automated via GitOps pipelines.
* All deployments logged with YAML:

  ```yaml
  deployment_log:
    cr_id: CR-2025-118
    environment: production
    deploy_time: 2025-08-23 16:45 UTC
    deployed_by: ENG-11
    status: success
  ```

### Step 6: Verification

* Post-deployment monitoring in Grafana.
* Ops team validates system health within 1 hour.

### Step 7: Closure

* CR marked as `Closed` in tracker.
* Lessons learned appended if issues occurred.

## **16.4 Deployment Environments**

1. **Development** – Individual engineer workspaces.
2. **Staging/QA** – Mirror of production with anonymized test data.
3. **Production** – Live Server Café environment.

**Rule**: No direct deployments to production without staging validation.

---

## **16.5 Rollback Procedures**

* Every CR must include rollback steps.
* Rollback executed if:

  * System stability compromised
  * Security failure detected
  * SLA breach triggered
* Rollback YAML log:

  ```yaml
  rollback_log:
    cr_id: CR-2025-118
    rollback_time: 2025-08-23 17:05 UTC
    reason: latency_spike
    executed_by: OPS-02
    status: complete
  ```

---

## **16.6 Tools and Automation**

* **GitOps**: ArgoCD/Flux for deployment automation.
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Jenkins pipelines.
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana.
* **Alerting**: PagerDuty for on-call escalation.
* **Compliance Checkers**: Automated GDPR/HIPAA validation scripts.

---

## **16.7 Staff Responsibilities**

* **Engineers**: Submit CRs, write rollback plans, test changes.
* **Compliance Officers**: Validate regulatory alignment.
* **Ops Manager**: Approve and schedule deployments.
* **CAB**: Approve high-impact changes.
* **SecOps**: Monitor for anomalies post-deployment.

---

## **16.8 Summary**

Change management and deployment procedures guarantee that **no modification enters Server Café without review, testing, and audit logs**. This protects system stability, ensures compliance, and maintains trust across all stakeholders.
