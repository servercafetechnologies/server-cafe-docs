# 2.1.3 Cooling

Proper cooling is essential for maintaining system stability, extending hardware lifespan, and meeting ASHRAE thermal guidelines. This section defines the standards, equipment, and procedures required to ensure all Server Café nodes operate safely within specified thermal envelopes.

---

## 2.1.3.1 Thermal Design Requirements

**Objective:** Establish baseline environmental requirements for safe operation.

**Procedure:**
- Target inlet temperature: **18–27°C (64–80°F)** per ASHRAE guidelines.
- Maximum allowable humidity: **60% RH**, with condensation prevention required.
- Continuous monitoring using environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, airflow) in each rack.
- Define thermal load: residential nodes ~8–10 kW, commercial nodes up to 75 kW.

**Deliverable:** A **Thermal Load Calculation Sheet** confirming HVAC sizing and rack airflow design.

## 2.1.3.2 HVAC System Selection

**Objective:** Install cooling systems sized for the node’s expected thermal output.

**Procedure:**
- **Residential Nodes:**
  - Use **2-ton mini-split HVAC units** (SEER ≥ 20).
  - Ensure redundancy with dual units where uptime is mission-critical.
- **Commercial Nodes:**
  - Deploy **Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units** or **InRow cooling systems** sized for 75 kW load.
  - Provide N+1 redundancy for all cooling equipment.
- Ensure airflow isolation (hot aisle / cold aisle containment) in rack layouts.

**Deliverable:** An **HVAC Installation Report** including model numbers, capacity ratings, and redundancy confirmation.

---

## 2.1.3.3 Airflow Management

**Objective:** Prevent hotspots and uneven cooling within racks.

**Procedure:**
- Install blanking panels in all unused rack spaces to prevent recirculation.
- Use cable management to avoid airflow blockages.
- Employ underfloor or overhead air distribution in commercial sites.
- Install containment barriers for hot/cold aisles.
- Validate airflow patterns with smoke testing during commissioning.

**Deliverable:** An **Airflow Validation Report** with thermal imaging and smoke test results.

## 2.1.3.4 Monitoring and Alerts

**Objective:** Continuously monitor cooling performance and ensure rapid response to anomalies.

**Procedure:**
- Deploy environmental monitoring sensors (Raritan EMX or equivalent) at top, middle, and bottom of each rack.
- Configure thresholds:
  - Temperature > 27°C → Level 1 alert.
  - Temperature > 32°C → Level 2 critical alert.
  - Humidity > 60% RH → Alert.
- Integrate alerts into central monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) and security SIEM.
- Configure automated escalation to HITL operators and Ops Lead.

**Deliverable:** A **Cooling Monitoring Report** with sample alert logs and escalation paths.

---

## 2.1.3.5 Maintenance Schedule

**Objective:** Ensure long-term reliability of HVAC and airflow systems.

**Procedure:**
- **Daily:** Visual inspection of air intakes and exhausts.
- **Weekly:** Clean filters, check for obstructions, verify sensor calibration.
- **Quarterly:** Inspect refrigerant levels, test redundancy switchover.
- **Annual:** Replace filters, conduct professional HVAC service, and recalibrate sensors.

**Deliverable:** A **Cooling Maintenance Logbook** signed weekly by the assigned operator, stored in the compliance archive.

---

## 2.1.3.6 Emergency Cooling Protocols

**Objective:** Maintain system uptime during HVAC failures.

**Procedure:**
- Install backup portable cooling units (≥ 10 kW spot coolers) for residential nodes.
- Commercial nodes: maintain onsite agreements with HVAC service providers for <4h response.
- Configure automated workload throttling if rack temps exceed 32°C.
- HITL operators trained to execute safe shutdown procedures when temps exceed 40°C sustained.

**Deliverable:** An **Emergency Cooling Procedure Binder** located at each node, reviewed during quarterly drills.

---

## 2.1.3.7 Final Approval

**Objective:** Certify cooling system readiness before installation of compute equipment.

**Procedure:**
- Consolidate deliverables: Thermal Load Calculation Sheet, HVAC Installation Report, Airflow Validation Report, Cooling Monitoring Report, Maintenance Logbook, and Emergency Procedure Binder.
- Submit packet to Operations Lead for approval.

**Deliverable:** A signed **Cooling Approval Certificate**, required before proceeding to Section 2.1.4 (Power Budgeting).
