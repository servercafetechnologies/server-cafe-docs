# 3.4 Core Tools Used in Operations

Operators and engineers rely on a standardized suite of tools to manage Server CafÃ© nodes. These tools provide visibility, logging, and control over orchestration processes, ensuring that both automated and HITL functions remain transparent, auditable, and resilient.

---

## 3.4.1 Operator Console Dashboard

**Purpose:** Central interface for HITL operators to review divergences, bias alerts, and compliance flags.

**Features:**
- Real-time case queue of arbitration tasks.
- Side-by-side vendor outputs with divergence scores.
- Bias detection overlay highlighting flagged terms.
- YAML log entry generator for operator decisions.
- Escalation button for Tier 2/3 review.

**Requirements:**
- Redundant workstation setup (dual-monitor, encrypted communications, UPS power).
- Secure login (badge + biometric).
- 24/7 availability with role-based access control.

**Deliverable:** A **Console User Guide** with screenshots, workflows, and YAML examples.

---

## 3.4.2 Prometheus & Grafana

**Purpose:** Collect and visualize system performance metrics.

**Metrics Monitored:**
- CPU, memory, and disk utilization.
- Token throughput and request latency.
- Solar yield, battery SOC, and grid fallback usage.
- Arbitration resolution times.

**Procedures:**
- Configure Prometheus exporters on all servers.
- Build Grafana dashboards segmented by stack (US, NATO, Global).
- Configure alert thresholds (e.g., CPU > 85%, battery SOC < 20%).

**Deliverable:** A **Metrics Dashboard Report** with screenshots and alert configuration.

---

## 3.4.3 ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

**Purpose:** Centralized log management for all orchestration layers and operator actions.

**Procedures:**
- Forward system logs, YAML-stamped orchestration logs, and operator logs to Logstash.
- Index data in Elasticsearch with role-based access.
- Use Kibana to create dashboards for log trends, anomaly detection, and compliance checks.
- Retain logs for minimum 7 years in compliance archive.

**Deliverable:** An **ELK Configuration Report** including log schemas, retention policies, and dashboard screenshots.

---

## 3.4.4 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

**Purpose:** Correlate security-related events across physical and digital domains.

**Monitored Events:**
- Rack door openings.
- Intrusion detection sensor triggers.
- Failed authentication attempts.
- Unexpected network traffic patterns.

**Procedures:**
- Integrate rack sensors, CCTV, and access control systems into SIEM.
- Correlate orchestration anomalies with physical access events.
- Configure automated alerts for suspicious activity.

**Deliverable:** A **SIEM Integration Report** with sample alerts and incident workflows.

---

## 3.4.5 YAML Audit Trail Generator

**Purpose:** Guarantee all orchestration events and operator actions are recorded in a consistent, immutable format.

**Procedures:**
- All events stamped with: message_type, from, to, purpose, payload, timestamp.
- Logs hashed with SHA-256 for tamper resistance.
- Replicate logs across 3 racks for redundancy.
- Export logs daily to compliance archive.

**Sample YAML:**
```yaml
message_type: hitl_decision
from: HITL_Operator_311
to: Dusk
purpose: compliance_override
payload:
  case_id: 76219
  decision: rejected
  rationale: "Vendor output failed HIPAA compliance"
  timestamp: 2025-08-22T19:00:00Z
```

**Deliverable:** A **YAML Logging Policy Document** with schemas, examples, and retention guidelines.

---

## 3.4.6 Final Approval

**Objective:** Certify that core toolsets are deployed, functional, and accessible to operators before continuous operations begin.

**Procedure:**
- Validate Console User Guide, Metrics Dashboard Report, ELK Configuration Report, SIEM Integration Report, and YAML Logging Policy Document.
- Test operator ability to perform arbitration tasks end-to-end.
- Obtain signoff from Operations Lead, HITL Coordinator, and Compliance Officer.

**Deliverable:** A signed **Core Tools Approval Certificate**, stored in the compliance archive.
