# 2. Deployment Workflows

This section establishes the standardized workflows for deploying Server Café Technologies nodes. Deployment workflows cover the full life cycle from site selection to software orchestration setup. Each step is detailed as a repeatable procedure that ensures every node, regardless of scale or geography, meets the same technical, ethical, and sustainability standards.

## 2.1 Overview of Deployment Stages

Deployment is divided into four primary stages:

1. **Site Preparation** – confirming legal, environmental, and infrastructure readiness before hardware arrives.
2. **Rack & Server Installation** – physical build-out of racks, servers, networking, and supporting systems.
3. **Software & Orchestration Setup** – installation of operating systems, orchestration layers, and monitoring tools.
4. **Validation & Handover** – testing, certification, and transfer of the node into operational status.

Each stage concludes with a deliverable: a formal document or checklist that verifies completion and compliance before moving to the next stage.

## 2.2 Principles of Deployment

1. **Repeatability:** Every deployment follows the same documented procedures to ensure uniform quality and auditability.
2. **Transparency:** Each step generates a record (checklist, YAML log, signed approval) stored in the compliance archive.
3. **Safety:** No deployment may proceed without fire suppression, power isolation, and operator safety protocols in place.
4. **Sustainability:** Solar-first design is mandatory. Grid and generator are secondary, not primary, sources of power.
5. **HITL Integration:** Operator access, consoles, and training must be included from the first day of deployment, not added later.

## 2.3 Deployment Workflow Outputs

- **Site Approval Report** (from 2.1.1–2.1.4): Confirms location suitability.
- **Physical Installation Log** (from 2.2.1–2.2.4): Documents rack, server, networking, and environmental controls.
- **Software Commissioning Report** (from 2.3.1–2.3.4): Verifies orchestration layers and monitoring.
- **Deployment Certification Packet** (from Section 2 overall): Combined approval signed by Operations Lead, Compliance Officer, and HITL Coordinator.

## 2.4 Transition to Operations

A node cannot be considered operational until:
- All four stages of deployment have been completed and documented.
- Compliance signoff has been issued by the Compliance Officer.
- HITL operators have completed onboarding and simulation drills.

Only when these conditions are met does the node formally enter **Day-to-Day Operations** (Section 3).
