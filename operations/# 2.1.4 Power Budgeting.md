# 2.1.4 Power Budgeting

Power budgeting ensures that every Server Café node has sufficient, reliable, and sustainable energy to support continuous operations. This section defines how to calculate power requirements, size solar and backup systems, and document interconnects with the local grid.

## 2.1.4.1 Load Estimation

**Objective:** Calculate total node power requirements under peak and steady-state conditions.

**Procedure:**
- **Server Loads:**
  - Dell XR4520c: ~800W each under full load.
  - Supermicro SYS-111E (GPU): 1,200–1,500W per unit.
  - Lenovo SE350: ~400W.
- **Networking Equipment:** Cisco Catalyst/Ubiquiti Pro switches: 250–400W each.
- **Ancillary Systems:**
  - HVAC (residential mini-split): 2–3 kW.
  - HVAC (commercial CRAC): 20–25 kW.
  - Fire suppression & sensors: < 500W total.
  - Lighting/security: ~200W.
- **Residential Node Total:** ~8–10 kW.
- **Commercial Node Total:** ~50–75 kW.

**Deliverable:** A **Power Load Calculation Sheet** listing each component and total kW draw.

## 2.1.4.2 Solar Array Sizing

**Objective:** Size solar arrays to meet 100% of average daily load with buffer.

**Procedure:**
- Use irradiance data from Section 2.1.1.
- Residential node: ~10 kW array (30–40 panels at 300–350W each).
- Commercial node: 60–100 kW array (150–280 panels depending on panel rating).
- Include 25% buffer above calculated load to account for inverter losses and seasonal dips.
- Mounting:
  - Residential: Roof- or ground-mounted, 300–400 sq. ft.
  - Commercial: Flat-roof ballasted or ground array, up to 0.5 acre.

**Deliverable:** A **Solar Sizing Report** detailing panel type, count, inverter model, and mounting plan.

## 2.1.4.3 Battery Storage

**Objective:** Provide sufficient storage for overnight and cloudy-day operation.

**Procedure:**
- Use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries for safety and longevity.
- Residential node:
  - Minimum: 40 kWh storage.
  - Preferred: 60–85 kWh (e.g., EG4 5.12 kWh packs, 8–16 units).
- Commercial node:
  - Minimum: 200 kWh.
  - Preferred: 300–400 kWh (rack-mounted packs in modular arrays).
- Configure battery management system (BMS) with redundancy and remote monitoring.

**Deliverable:** A **Battery Configuration Report** including model numbers, capacity charts, and redundancy plan.

---

## 2.1.4.4 Grid Interconnect

**Objective:** Ensure safe and compliant connection to the local power grid.

**Procedure:**
- Residential: Verify **200A minimum service panel**.
- Commercial: Verify **480V three-phase service**.
- Obtain utility interconnection approval for net metering.
- Install transfer switch to allow seamless switching between solar, battery, and grid.
- Log all grid imports/exports for compliance and cost tracking.

**Deliverable:** A **Grid Interconnect Approval Packet** containing utility documentation, transfer switch schematics, and test results.

---

## 2.1.4.5 Backup Generation

**Objective:** Provide tertiary power in case of extended outages.

**Procedure:**
- Residential: Optional 10–15 kW standby generator (natural gas or propane).
- Commercial: Required 50–100 kW diesel generator with 48h fuel reserve.
- Ensure noise enclosures reduce output to <70 dBA at property line.
- Test generators monthly under load.

**Deliverable:** A **Backup Generator Test Log** with monthly run records and service history.

---

## 2.1.4.6 Power Monitoring and Alerts

**Objective:** Continuously track power availability and health of solar, battery, and grid systems.

**Procedure:**
- Install smart meters at all inputs (solar inverter, battery, grid, generator).
- Configure monitoring agents to:
  - Alert at battery SOC < 20%.
  - Log all grid imports exceeding 2 consecutive hours.
  - Flag inverter efficiency below 90%.
- Integrate data into central Grafana dashboards with YAML-stamped logs.

**Deliverable:** A **Power Monitoring Report** with live dashboards and quarterly audit summaries.

---

## 2.1.4.7 Final Approval

**Objective:** Certify that power infrastructure can sustain continuous operations.

**Procedure:**
- Consolidate all deliverables: Load Calculation Sheet, Solar Sizing Report, Battery Configuration Report, Grid Interconnect Approval Packet, Backup Generator Test Log, and Power Monitoring Report.
- Submit to Operations Lead and Compliance Officer for final signoff.

**Deliverable:** A signed **Power Budgeting Approval Certificate**, required before proceeding to Section 2.2 (Rack & Server Installation).
