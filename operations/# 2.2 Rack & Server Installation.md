# 2.2 Rack & Server Installation

Rack and server installation translates the approved site into a functioning compute environment. This phase covers the physical assembly of racks, server hardware, networking, supporting infrastructure, and associated documentation. Installation must be carried out only after **Sections 2.1.1–2.1.4 approvals** are complete.

## 2.2.1 Standard Racks

**Objective:** Establish standardized, secure enclosures for compute and networking gear.

**Procedure:**
- Deploy **42U APC NetShelter SX racks** (load rating: 3,000 lbs) for all deployments.
- Install acoustic or lockable doors to reduce noise (15–20 dB reduction) and prevent unauthorized access.
- Bolt racks to the floor slab with seismic-rated anchors.
- Provide 1.2m (4 ft) clearance in front and 0.9m (3 ft) behind for service access.
- Implement hot aisle/cold aisle orientation when using multiple racks.

**Deliverable:** A **Rack Installation Report** with photos, anchoring records, and clearance diagrams.

## 2.2.2 Server Mix

**Objective:** Populate racks with approved server configurations based on node type.

**Procedure:**
- **Residential Node (~8–10 kW):**
  - 2 × Dell XR4520c edge servers (~800W each).
  - 1 × Lenovo ThinkEdge SE350 (~400W).
- **Commercial Node (50–75 kW):**
  - 6–8 × Supermicro SYS-111E GPU servers (1.2–1.5 kW each).
  - 4–6 × Dell XR4520c (~800W each).
  - 2 × Lenovo SE350 for resilience and management roles.
- Install all servers on sliding rails, with cable management arms.
- Record serial numbers, firmware revisions, and power supply configurations.

**Deliverable:** A **Server Inventory Sheet** capturing make, model, serial, and rack position.

## 2.2.3 Networking

**Objective:** Build a redundant, segmented network backbone for multi-stack orchestration.

**Procedure:**
- Install redundant switches:
  - Residential: 2 × Ubiquiti UniFi Pro 24-port (250W each).
  - Commercial: 2 × Cisco Catalyst 9300 (400W each).
- Configure VLAN segmentation:
  - VLAN 10 = US Stack.
  - VLAN 20 = NATO Stack.
  - VLAN 30 = Global Stack.
- Deploy patch panels (Cat6) with color-coded cabling.
- Test throughput and latency with iPerf3.

**Deliverable:** A **Network Configuration Report** including VLAN maps, patch panel layouts, and test logs.

---

## 2.2.4 Non-Compute Infrastructure

**Objective:** Ensure all supporting systems are installed and integrated.

**Procedure:**
- **UPS Systems:**
  - Residential: APC Smart-UPS SRT 6000VA.
  - Commercial: Modular UPS with ≥ 50 kVA capacity.
- **Fire Suppression:** Stat-X aerosol units, 2U per rack; integrate into environmental monitoring system.
- **Environmental Sensors:** Deploy Raritan EMX or equivalent for temperature, humidity, and airflow.
- **Cable Management:** Use Velcro straps, ladder trays, and underfloor routing to maintain airflow.
- **Labeling:** Apply unique asset IDs to all cables, panels, and devices.

**Deliverable:** A **Non-Compute Installation Log** documenting UPS battery tests, fire suppression certifications, and sensor calibration.

---

## 2.2.5 Validation and Handover

**Objective:** Confirm installation integrity and prepare for software deployment.

**Procedure:**
- Perform rack shake test and anchor inspection.
- Verify server power-on self-test (POST) for all units.
- Validate networking VLANs and failover paths.
- Run initial UPS runtime tests with load banks.
- Complete fire suppression discharge test (inert simulation if available).

**Deliverable:** A **Rack & Server Installation Certificate**, signed by Operations Lead and Compliance Officer, required before proceeding to Section 2.3 (Software & Orchestration Setup).
