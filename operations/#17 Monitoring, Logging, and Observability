# **Section 17: Monitoring, Logging, and Observability**

This section defines how Server Café ensures full visibility into system health, performance, and security. Monitoring, logging, and observability form the foundation for proactive operations, incident detection, and audit compliance.

---

## **17.1 Purpose of Monitoring and Observability**

* **Early Detection** – Identify anomalies before they impact clients.
* **Transparency** – Provide real-time visibility into system operations.
* **Compliance** – Maintain regulatory-grade audit logs.
* **Continuous Improvement** – Use metrics and logs to drive optimizations.

---

## **17.2 Monitoring Stack**

### Core Tools

* **Prometheus** – Metrics collection (CPU, memory, network, custom application metrics).
* **Grafana** – Dashboards for visualization.
* **Elasticsearch** – Log indexing.
* **Logstash** – Log ingestion pipeline.
* **Kibana** – Log analysis and visualization.
* **Wazuh/OSSEC** – Host-based intrusion detection.

### Metrics Monitored

* System: CPU %, memory %, disk usage, IOPS.
* Network: Latency, throughput, packet loss.
* Application: Query response times, AI vendor latency.
* Power: Solar input, battery charge, grid usage.
* Security: IDS/IPS alerts, failed logins, anomalous traffic.

## **17.3 Logging Requirements**

### Log Categories

1. **System Logs** – OS, kernel, service logs.
2. **Application Logs** – Server Café orchestration events.
3. **Security Logs** – Firewall, IDS, IAM events.
4. **Compliance Logs** – YAML-stamped reasoning, HITL reviews, CR approvals.

### Retention Policies

* **Compliance Logs**: 7 years (immutable WORM storage).
* **Security Logs**: 2 years.
* **System/Application Logs**: 1 year.

### Log Format

* All compliance-related logs must be **YAML-stamped**.
* Example:

  ```yaml
  reasoning_log:
    request_id: RQ-2025-2012
    dawn_validation: passed
    day_agents: [Claude, GPT, Gemini]
    dusk_review: compliance_checked
    confidence: 0.93
    reviewer: HITL-07
    timestamp: 2025-08-23 18:30 UTC
  ```

## **17.4 Observability Practices**

* **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry used for distributed tracing of queries.
* **Correlation IDs**: Each request tagged with unique ID for end-to-end tracking.
* **Dashboards**: Custom Grafana dashboards by stack (US, NATO, Global).
* **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**:

  * Availability: 99.9%
  * Latency: <250ms median response
  * Error Rate: <1%

---

## **17.5 Alerting and Escalation**

* **Alert Manager** integrated with Prometheus.
* Alerts classified:

  * **Info** – Not urgent, logged.
  * **Warning** – Requires action in 24 hours.
  * **Critical** – Immediate on-call response.
* **Escalation**:

  1. Engineer on-call (PagerDuty notification).
  2. SecOps Lead if unresolved within 30 minutes.
  3. Ops Manager after 1 hour.

---

## **17.6 Dashboards and Reporting**

* **Daily Reports**: Auto-generated, stored in `/srv/reports/daily/`.
* **Weekly Summary**: Sent to Ops Manager, includes:

  * Top 10 alerts by frequency
  * System uptime metrics
  * SLA adherence
* **Quarterly Trends**: Presented at Review Board (ties into Section 14).

---

## **17.7 Automation and Self-Healing**

* **Auto-Scaling**: Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).
* **Self-Healing Scripts**:

  * Restart failed pods.
  * Reroute traffic during network degradation.
* **Predictive Maintenance**:

  * ML models forecast hardware failures based on trends.

---

## **17.8 Staff Responsibilities**

* **Engineers**: Maintain dashboards and metrics.
* **SecOps**: Monitor security alerts.
* **Compliance Officers**: Audit logs for adherence.
* **Ops Manager**: Review weekly summaries, act on trends.

---

## **17.9 Summary**

Monitoring, logging, and observability ensure that Server Café operates with **eyes wide open**. With real-time visibility, structured YAML compliance logs, and predictive alerting, Server Café achieves resilience, transparency, and trustworthiness in all environments.
