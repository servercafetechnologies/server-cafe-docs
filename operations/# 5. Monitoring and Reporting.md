# 5. Monitoring and Reporting

Monitoring and reporting provide continuous visibility into the health, performance, and compliance status of Server Café nodes. This section defines the metrics collected, alert thresholds, reporting schedules, and logging procedures that ensure accountability and transparency.

---

## 5.1 System Metrics

**Objective:** Track core infrastructure performance to maintain SLA compliance.

**Metrics Monitored:**
- **Uptime:** Target ≥ 99.9% monthly.
- **Throughput:** Tokens/sec per stack (300–600 residential, 600+ commercial).
- **Latency:** Target < 200 ms internal orchestration.
- **Power Efficiency:** ≤ 0.5 kWh per 1M tokens processed.
- **Cooling:** Average inlet ≤ 27°C, no spikes > 32°C sustained.

**Procedure:**
- Metrics collected via Prometheus exporters.
- Visualized in Grafana dashboards segmented by stack.
- Threshold alerts configured in Prometheus Alertmanager.

**Deliverable:** Daily **System Health Report** and consolidated **Weekly Performance Packet**.

## 5.2 HITL Metrics

**Objective:** Ensure human oversight remains effective and measurable.

**Metrics Monitored:**
- Average arbitration time (< 45s).
- Escalation ratio (< 5%).
- Bias correction rate (≥ 10%).
- Accuracy alignment (≥ 95%).
- Operator utilization (60–75%).

**Procedure:**
- Metrics automatically logged from HITL consoles.
- Stored in ELK stack and replicated across racks.
- Reviewed weekly by Operations Lead and HITL Coordinator.

**Deliverable:** Weekly **HITL Metrics Report** and quarterly **Compliance HITL Audit**.

## 5.3 Alerting

**Objective:** Provide real-time notifications for anomalies and SLA breaches.

**Alert Thresholds:**
- CPU > 85% for 10 min → Level 1 alert.
- Battery SOC < 20% → Critical alert.
- Arbitration > 5 min unresolved → Escalation required.
- Rack door access outside schedule → Security alert.

**Procedure:**
- Alerts integrated into SIEM platform.
- Automated escalation to Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Compliance Officer.
- Alerts logged in YAML format.

**Sample YAML Alert:**
```yaml
message_type: system_alert
from: monitoring_agent_07
stack: us
purpose: cooling_threshold_breach
payload:
  rack_id: R12
  temperature: 33C
  threshold: 27C
  status: critical
  timestamp: 2025-09-22T11:45:00Z
```

**Deliverable:** Daily **Alert Log Packet** with annotated responses.

## 5.4 Reporting Protocols

**Objective:** Define how operational data is summarized and archived.

**Reports Generated:**
- **Daily Ops Summary** (from Section 3).
- **System Health Report.**
- **HITL Metrics Report.**
- **Compliance Archive Packet.**

**Procedures:**
- Reports signed by Operations Lead before archiving.
- All reports hashed (SHA-256) and timestamped with NTP.
- Replicated across three racks and sent to central compliance archive.

**Deliverable:** Daily **Reporting Packet** for each node.

---

## 5.5 Audit and Transparency

**Objective:** Provide regulators and stakeholders with auditable records.

**Procedures:**
- Maintain 7-year log retention.
- Quarterly Compliance Review with regulators.
- Public transparency reports (non-sensitive data only).
- Community advisory board briefings (quarterly).

**Deliverable:** Quarterly **Compliance & Transparency Report**.

---

## 5.6 Final Approval

**Objective:** Certify that monitoring and reporting systems are fully operational.

**Procedure:**
- Validate daily and weekly reports.
- Confirm alerting thresholds and escalation paths tested.
- Obtain signoff from Operations Lead, Compliance Officer, and HITL Coordinator.

**Deliverable:** A signed **Monitoring & Reporting Approval Certificate**, required for external audits and SLA compliance verification.
