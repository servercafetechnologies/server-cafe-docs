Server Café's sales strategy transforms our "Switzerland of AI" positioning into systematic revenue generation through trust-based consultative selling.

## SALES STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

### **Core Sales Philosophy: "The Country Bar Approach"**

**Value-First Approach:**
- Lead with business value and risk mitigation, not technology features
