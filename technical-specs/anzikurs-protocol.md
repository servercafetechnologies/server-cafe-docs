# Server Café: Technical Architecture & Anzikurs Protocol

## System Overview

Server Café implements a three-layer orchestration architecture that enables transparent, scalable, and secure multi-AI collaboration. The Anzikurs Protocol provides the foundation for vendor-neutral AI orchestration with human oversight and complete auditability.

## Core Architecture: Dawn-Day-Dusk

### Dawn Layer: Input Validation & Security

**Purpose**: Gatekeeper for all incoming data and requests

**Components**:
- **Authentication Service**: Multi-factor authentication with role-based access control
- **Input Sanitizer**: XSS prevention, SQL injection protection, malformed data detection
- **Compliance Engine**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2 validation based on geographic stack
- **Rate Limiter**: Prevents abuse and manages API quotas across vendor services
- **Duplicate Detection**: Content fingerprinting reducing redundant processing by 20-25%

**Security Features**:
- Zero-trust network architecture
- End-to-end encryption (AES-256)
- Certificate-based mutual authentication
- Real-time threat detection and response

### Day Layer: Multi-AI Mediation Hub

**Purpose**: Orchestrate collaborative reasoning among diverse AI agents

**Consensus Building Process**:
1. **Task Distribution**: Parallel submission to selected AI vendors
2. **Response Collection**: Aggregation with confidence scoring
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Human-in-the-loop arbitration for disagreements >15% variance
4. **Iterative Refinement**: 3-5 rounds of consensus building
5. **Quality Scoring**: Automated assessment of response coherence and relevance

**AI Vendor Integration**:
- **OpenAI GPT**: Strategic reasoning and business analysis
- **Anthropic Claude**: Ethical oversight and synthesis
- **Google Gemini**: Technical analysis and scalability assessment
- **xAI Grok**: Innovation and market disruption insights
- **Extensible Framework**: Support for emerging providers

### Dusk Layer: Output Synthesis & Compliance

**Purpose**: Create unified, compliant, and auditable results

**Synthesis Engine**:
- **Content Merger**: Intelligent combination of diverse AI perspectives
- **Bias Detection**: Automated identification of cultural, gender, and ideological biases
- **Fact Verification**: Cross-referencing with trusted knowledge bases
- **Quality Assurance**: Grammar, coherence, and completeness validation

- ROI period: 3-4 years

## API & Integration Framework

**Core Endpoints**:
- POST /orchestrate/analyze
- GET /orchestrate/status/{request_id}
- GET /orchestrate/result/{request_id}
- GET /audit/trail/{request_id}

**Security & Compliance**:
- Data at rest: AES-256-GCM encryption
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3
- GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 compliance automation
- Real-time audit trail generation
